#Remote Access & FileSystem
This week we covered three terminal commands
`cd` , `ls` & `cat`

##The `cd` command
**Run with no arguments**

*working directory was `home/lecture1/`*
When run with no arguments `cd` changed the working directory to `home/`. It moved one level outside the previous working directory
This was not an error, although most programmers prefer using the command `cd..` for the same result
